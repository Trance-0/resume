The first half of the course will comprise a survey of Japanese history, with an emphasis on its social and cultural aspects, from the earliest period to the present day. Having established the historical framework- with its interweave of native and foreign elements, Kyoto-based imperial aristocracy, the samurai class and their crucial role, Zen-inspired meditative arts, and exquisitely diverse cultural products- the class will move on, in the second half, to an examination of recent and contemporary trends and issues. These will center on Japanese education, social and family structures, urban centers and the rural periphery, economic and socio-political trends, Japan's distinctive and vibrant popular culture, contemporary problems and challenges, and the nation's dramatically shifting position in East Asia and in the 21st-century global order."

Over the course of the semester, the students learn how macroscopic observations of stoichiometry, chemical reactions, the properties of elements and compounds, and chemical periodicity developed into the microscopic understanding of molecular structure and bonding. The semester begins with fundamentals related to stoichiometry, chemical reactions, solution chemistry, and gas properties, with an emphasis on quantitative problem solving. The octet rule, Lewis structures, and valence-shell-electron-pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory are then introduced as early efforts to describe the stability and structures of molecules. The localized electron model (LEM) and molecular-orbital theory (MOT) are next described as modern descriptions of chemical bonding. The course concludes with intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions. This course will be a serious introductory series that requires and develops algebraic-computation and problem-solving skills. Pre-requisite: Two years of high-school math, and one year of high-school chemistry or physics, or by permission of the instructors.

This does not mean that a student must be a budding technologist to succeed in this course, nor will this course seek to transform a student into one. Rather, this course treats \"technology\" in its broadest sense, from its root in the Greek techne (which means \"craftsmanship,\" \"craft,\" \"art,\" or \"rhetoric\") to its contemporary definition as the realm of knowledge that deals with the mechanical arts and applied sciences. In writing about technology, we will consider perspectives across the university curriculum in order to better comprehend our relationship with our tools and to scrutinize the dynamic interaction, communication, and interdependence of different kinds of tools for various means of communication and representation. We will strive to think critically about ourselves as part of larger communities and systems by attending closely to the ways we communicate with and about others through technologies such as writing, film, and social media. In writing creative, analytical, argumentative, and researched essays, we will address responsible uses of technology and the effects that technologies have on different communities and individuals, and we will try to answer questions like the following: How does technology affect us when we use it? How do technologies intersect and affect one another? What roles does technology play in our everyday lives? What roles do we want it to play in our future?

In addition to the central concepts and theories in each area, the course will address philosophical implications of this research concerning how the mind and brain are related, how the mind-brain encodes or represents information, and the nature of consciousness. And there will be an emphasis on applying these findings to important problems, such as Alzheimer's disease and deficits due to brain damage. The class is taught by three members of the faculty from different disciplines and combines a whole-group lecture with small discussion classes. The goal is to give students a good understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of cognitive science and to help them develop the ability to think and write critically about scientific research into the mind-brain.
