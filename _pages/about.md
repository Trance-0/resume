> It's such ironic a person who values privacy so much is writing a website to share his resume for living. As those who try to speak out their mind are mostly foolish. Unfortunatly, I am one of them.

I am Zheyuan, an open-minded lifelong learner with a strong passion for Artificial General Intelligence and Machine Learning, with the full awareness that he may never fully comprehend the world. For me, computer science is magic. They have spells (executive codes) and the power to harness (computer hardware). Computer science is based on the basis of the world (logic). My life goal is to understand the world as a wizard of computer science and utilize intelligent computing resources to make the world a happier place.
